As a sophomore student at Southeast Missouri State University studying cybersecurity, I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. I have basic skills in programming such as Python, Java, and JavaScript. I am also a strong communicator with excellent leadership skills. I value teamwork and believe that collaboration is key to achieving success in any project.

I am interested in cybersecurity because it is an ever-evolving field that requires constant learning and adaptation. The challenge of staying ahead of cyber threats and protecting sensitive information is what drives me to pursue a career in this field.
